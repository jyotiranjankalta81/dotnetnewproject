# MyWebApiProject

## Description
This project is a .NET WebAPI project designed to provide RESTful APIs for interacting with data. It follows a standard folder structure for organization and maintainability.

## Folder Structure

- **Controllers**: Contains the API controller classes responsible for handling HTTP requests.
- **Models**: Contains the data models used by the application.
- **Services**: Contains service classes responsible for business logic.
- **Data**: Contains the database context class (`ApplicationDbContext.cs`) and migration files.
- **DTOs** (Data Transfer Objects): Contains classes representing the data transferred between the client and server.
- **Utilities**: Contains utility/helper classes.
- **Middleware**: Contains custom middleware classes.
- **Filters**: Contains custom action filters.
- **Properties**: Contains project-specific configuration files.
- **appsettings.json**, **appsettings.Development.json**, **appsettings.Production.json**: Configuration files for storing application settings.
- **Startup.cs**: Configures the application's request pipeline and services.
- **Program.cs**: Entry point of the application.
- **MyWebApiProject.csproj**: Project file containing project settings and references.
- **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.

## Notes
- Make sure to set up appropriate connection strings and database configurations in the `appsettings.json` files.
- Use dependency injection in `Startup.cs` to register services and configure the application's middleware pipeline.
- Ensure proper error handling and validation in controllers and services.
- Keep the DTOs lightweight and focused on data transfer between client and server.
- Utilize middleware and action filters for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, authentication, and authorization.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Update database connection strings and other configurations in `appsettings.json`.
4. Run Entity Framework Core migrations to create/update the database schema.
5. Build and run the project to start the WebAPI server.
